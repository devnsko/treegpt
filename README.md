## TreeGPT

TreeGPT ([https://github.com/devnsko/treegpt](https://github.com/devnsko/treegpt)) visualizes your ChatGPT conversations as a 3D graph, grouped by semantic meaning. The Java part handles the visualization of large graphs, so performance may be slower with bigger datasets.

## GPTArchiveParse

GPTArchiveParse ([https://github.com/devnsko/gptarchiveparse](https://github.com/devnsko/gptarchiveparse)) is a Python tool for parsing ChatGPT conversation archives. It prepares the data for further analysis or visualization in TreeGPT.


If you want, I can make a **full README version** with installation instructions, usage examples, and a small diagram showing how both projects work together. Do you want me to do that?
